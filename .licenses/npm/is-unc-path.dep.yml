    isUncPath('\\foo\admin$\system32');
    isUncPath('\\foo\temp');

    isUncPath('\\\/foo/bar');

    **false**

    Returns false for non-UNC paths:

    ```js
    isUncPath('/foo/bar');
    isUncPath('/');
    isUncPath('/foo');
    isUncPath('/foo/');
    isUncPath('c:');
    isUncPath('c:.');
    isUncPath('c:./');
    isUncPath('c:./file');
    isUncPath('c:/');
    isUncPath('c:/file');
    ```

    **Customization**

    Use `.source` to use the regex as a component of another regex:

    ```js
    var myRegex = new RegExp(isUncPath.source + 'foo');
    ```

    **[Rules for UNC paths](http://resources.esri.com/help/9.3/ArcGISDesktop/com/Gp_ToolRef/sharing_tools_and_toolboxes/pathnames_explained_colon_absolute_relative_unc_and_url.htm)**

    * The computer name is always preceded by a double backward-slash (`\\`).
    * UNC paths cannot contain a drive letter (such as `D:`)
